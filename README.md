## Hi there 👋

My name is Agathe (pronounced like _a-cat_, but with a "g" 😉); I am a product manager focused on growing and scaling developer tools. I am a fierce advocate for DevX and great API documentation. I am from France, working remotely since 2017 and usually somewhere hot during winter 🥶

### 🤝 My communication & work  style
- I am direct and honest and will tell you when I have doubts, concerns, or objections. Please do the same with me!
- In true product manager fashion, I love to-do lists and clear objectives... They motivate me daily!

### 📫 Let's connect!
Email me at agathe.brusset (at) gmail.com, contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agathebrusset), or write me a message on my [website](https://agathe-brusset.com/contact)! I love to chat about product management best practices, pricing strategies or feature improvements.

### ⚡ Fun fact
I traveled to 30+ countries and lived in 5 different countries across three continents. I'm also a certified yoga teacher and krav-maga and muay thai enthusiast.
